# Reinforcement_CartPole

This project provides a sample implementation of the classic game CartPole from the OpenAI Gym environment using three different reinforcement learning algorithms:

1. **Q-learning**
2. **Double DQN (DDQN)**
3. **REINFORCE**

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Q-learning

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a policy by estimating the values of actions in each state.

### 2. Double DQN (DDQN)

Double DQN is an extension of the original DQN algorithm. It addresses the overestimation bias problem by using two separate networks for selecting and evaluating actions.

### 3. REINFORCE

REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient) is a policy gradient method that directly learns the policy by maximizing the expected cumulative reward.
